# <a name='overview'></a>Overview
Golden Amazon Machine Image (AMI) pipeline enables creation, distribution, verification, launch-compliance of the AMI and creates a continuous and repeatable process for the consumers to generate the golden AMI. Currently when a user wants to build, test and distribute a Golden AMI across multiple accounts/regions, user will have to create multiple resources including image recipes, build and test steps, infrastructure creation and distribution step and connect them together in image pipeline using EC2 Image Builder service. User needs to define each stage and resources required for each stage of the image builder pipeline which is a lengthy process

In this solution, we will be using EC2 Image Builder service for the heavy lifting work of building, testing and distributing the Golden AMI. The code repository contains all the configuration files provided the user. These configuration files will define how the AMI will be built, tested and distributed across multiple accounts/regions. AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) application will read configuration file ( the details of the configuration file provided by user is described in Configuration File section) and deploy the necessary resources to create AMI Pipeline.

# <a name='solution'></a>Solution
Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, which is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. A golden AMI is an AMI that contains the latest security patches, software, configuration, and software agents that you need to install for logging, security maintenance, and performance monitoring.
In this solution, we will provide users a way to deploy Golden AMI Pipeline using AWS CDK as Infrastructure as Code that will be driven by user configuration. User will be able to provide all configuration information including build, test, distribution that can be used by the AWS CDK application to create and customize the Golden AMI Pipeline. The solution will ensure that the Security best practice is also integrated for AMI Image encryption and distribution. On a **high** level, the image builder pipeline consists of the following -

- Recipe
    -   What Base Image to Use
    -   What are the Build steps
    -   What are the Test and validate steps
- Infrastructure
    -   What type of EC2 instance to launch, build, test
    -   Which VPC, Subnet and Security Group to use while launching the instance.
- Distribution
    -   Where to Distribute the AMI after creation - which account/region
    -   What tag will be added in the AMI in the target account 



# <a name='arch'></a>Target Architecture

![alt text](images/Golden_AMI_v2.png)

# <a name='keyfeatures'></a>Key Features 
-   As part of the security best practice, there will be one Customer Managed Key (CMK) created per pipeline and the underlying Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume of AMI will be encrypted with the same. This can be turned on/off with parameters which is described later.

-   Base image can refer to AWS managed public Parameter Store, a capability of AWS Systems Manager (for example - /aws/service/eks/optimized-ami/1.14/amazon-linux-2/recommended) that holds the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI or latest Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) optimized AMI or it can refer any Base AMI ID (ami-0123456789) that is available in the region where the service is being deployed

-   User can bring their own Build and Test steps ( in yaml file) or AWS managed pre-build Systems Manager documentation can also be used.

-   Image Pipeline will send Amazon SNS (Amazon Simple Notification) notification for success or failure.

-   AMI Pipeline creation is configuration driven. AWS CDK application will read the user provided configuration and provision the pipeline. 


# <a name='limitations'></a>Limitations
- An EC2 Image Builder recipe defines the base image to use as your starting point to create a new image, along with the set of components that you add to customize your image and verify that everything is working as expected. A maximum of 20 components, which include build and test, can be applied to a recipe. After you create an image recipe you cannot modify or replace the recipe. To update components after a recipe is created, you must create a new recipe or recipe version. Pease check the parameter details section [here](#parameterdetails) on how to provide the recipe version. Any changes to base image, components ( ad/delete/update/re-order) requires a new recipe or recipe version. More information on recipe can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/manage-recipes.html)
- Updating to any existing component requires a new version to be created. Pease check the parameter details section [here](#parameterdetails) on how to provide the component version

# <a name='prereq'></a>Pre-Requisite

-   Ensure you have a Git client installed following [these](https://git-scm.com/downloads) instruction
-   Set up AWS Credentials in your environment using [these](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html) instruction
-   Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
-   An active AWS account
-   A web browser that is supported for use with the AWS Management Console. (See the [list](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/browsers-management-console/) of supported browsers)
-   AWS CDK (version2 )  CLI. Refer [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html) on how to install

To configure cross-account distribution permissions in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), follow these steps:

1. To use Image Builder AMIs that are distributed across accounts, the destination account owner must create a new IAM role in their account called ```EC2ImageBuilderDistributionCrossAccountRole```.

2. They must attach the ```Ec2ImageBuilderCrossAccountDistributionAccess``` policy to the role to enable cross-account distribution.

3. Verify that the source account ID is added to the trust policy attached to the IAM role of the destination account. Example - 
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::<SOURCE_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:root"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
4. If the AMI you distribute is encrypted, the destination account owner must add the following inline policy to the ```EC2ImageBuilderDistributionCrossAccountRole``` in their account so that they can use your KMS keys. The Principal section contains their account number. This enables Image Builder to act on their behalf when it uses AWS KMS to encrypt and decrypt the AMI with the appropriate keys for each Region.

:pushpin: set ```iamEncryption``` parameter in ```bin/config.json``` file to enable/disable encryption. More information can be found [here](#parameterdetails)
```

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "kms:CreateGrant",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:DescribeKey",
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Generate*",
                "kms:ListGrants",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": "ec2:CreateTags",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*::snapshot/*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

# <a name='conclusion'></a>Conclusion

In today’s world, organizations need to be agile and be able to scale their applications based on
the demand. Applications need operating systems to run and operating systems need to have
tools and third party apps installed on them and properly patched on a regular basis. Maintaining
and managing organization-wide operating systems at scale can be a challenging task for the
operation teams. Manually setting up servers just doesn’t scale. With this solution, customers can
build, test, and deploy custom-built, secure AMIs for their organization and distribute them in a
multi-account environment.
